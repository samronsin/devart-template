# Fourier Crystal Rain

## Description
This work is an attempt to share my love and fascination with a mathematical function, namely the Fourier transform, and its famous implementation, the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Despite being quite ubiquituous in signal processing, the FFT hasn't been much used in generative art, and this project wishes to help correct that. 
I also love texture images, around which this project is built. Textures are ambiguous mathematical objects, designed for infinity and chaos. This work aims at displaying visually some of the vertigo that I felt while studying textures from a mathematical perspective.
